# Yale x Qiskit Fall Fest 2022


## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Yale. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by [YuQC](https://yaleqc.com/), which you should absolutely join if you haven't already!

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here at Yale is going to be a pseudo-hackathon, starting on October 3rd. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October 15th, at 2pm ET. Good luck!
