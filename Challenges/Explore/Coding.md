Complete one or more of the following challenges in the **Coding** category!

1. Create a program that builds an oracle for a given string (e.g. given 01101, will return a QuantumCircuit that inverts the phase of the state |01101> and leaves all other states unchanged.
2. Tackle an open issue in the Qiskit Terra repo.
3. Create a program that builds an oracle circuit from a problem. Assess how the size of your circuits grow with the size of the problem.
4. Try making a quantum game.
