# Mathematical

Complete one or more of the following challenges in the **Mathematical** category!

1. Work out how many times Grover’s algorithm needs to query the oracle if there are multiple solutions. Write up your working as a blog post or jupyter notebook.

2. Write an introduction to “maths for quantum computing”. Research the math needed to read other quantum computing textbooks and build a guide for new learners.

3. Investigate how you would combine Schöning’s algorithm with Grover’s algorithm. What would a circuit for this look like? Are there any potential problems?
